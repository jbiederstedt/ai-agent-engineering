    "* LangGraph is a framework different from LangChain and designed for building agentic and multi-agent applications.\n",
    "* LangGraph works very well with LangChain. LangGraph apps usually use many features from LangChain, but you could use LangGraph without LangChain.\n",
    "* Goals:\n",
    "    * Build agents that can reliably handle different types of day-to-day tasks in your work.\n",
    "    * Add precision and control into agentic workflows."
