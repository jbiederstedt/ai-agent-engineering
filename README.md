# AI Agent Engineering with LangGraph

This repository contains the practical implementations and exercises from the **[2025 Bootcamp: Understand and Build Professional AI Agents](https://www.udemy.com/course/2025-bootcamp-understand-and-build-professional-ai-agents/)** online course by Julio Colomer.

The course covers advanced concepts in AI agent development using LangGraph, LangChain, and modern AI technologies.
